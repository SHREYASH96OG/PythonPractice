# 415. Add Strings
# Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

# You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
# Output: "134"
# Example 2:

# Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
# Output: "533"
# Example 3:

# Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
# Output: "0"
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
# num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
# num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

# solution
class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        num1 = int(num1)
        num2 = int(num2)
        add = num1 + num2
        add = str(add)
        return add
